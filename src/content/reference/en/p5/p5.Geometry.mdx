description: >
  <p>A class to describe a 3D shape.</p>

  <p>Each <code>p5.Geometry</code> object represents a 3D shape as a set of
  connected

  points called vertices. All 3D shapes are made by connecting vertices to

  form triangles that are stitched together. Each triangular patch on the

  geometry's surface is called a face. The geometry stores information

  about its vertices and faces for use with effects such as lighting and

  texture mapping.</p>

  <p>The first parameter, <code>detailX</code>, is optional. If a number is
  passed, as in

  <code>new p5.Geometry(24)</code>, it sets the number of triangle subdivisions
  to use

  along the geometry's x-axis. By default, <code>detailX</code> is 1.</p>

  <p>The second parameter, <code>detailY</code>, is also optional. If a number
  is passed,

  as in <code>new p5.Geometry(24, 16)</code>, it sets the number of triangle

  subdivisions to use along the geometry's y-axis. By default,
  <code>detailX</code> is

  1.</p>

  <p>The third parameter, <code>callback</code>, is also optional. If a function
  is passed,

  as in <code>new p5.Geometry(24, 16, createShape)</code>, it will be called
  once to add

  vertices to the new 3D shape.</p>

      <p>Flips the geometry’s texture v-coordinates.</p>

      <p>In order for <a href="/reference/p5/texture/">texture()</a> to work,
      the geometry

      needs a way to map the points on its surface to the pixels in a
      rectangular

      image that's used as a texture. The geometry's vertex at coordinates

      <code>(x, y, z)</code> maps to the texture image's pixel at coordinates
      <code>(u, v)</code>.</p>

      <p>The <a href="/reference/p5.Geometry/uvs/">myGeometry.uvs</a> array
      stores the

      <code>(u, v)</code> coordinates for each vertex in the order it was added
      to the

      geometry. Calling <code>myGeometry.flipV()</code> flips a geometry's
      v-coordinates

      so that the texture appears mirrored vertically.</p>

      <p>For example, a plane's four vertices are added clockwise starting from
      the

      top-left corner. Here's how calling <code>myGeometry.flipV()</code> would
      change a

      plane's texture coordinates:</p>

      <pre><code class="language-js">// Print the original texture coordinates.

      // Output: [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]

      console.log(myGeometry.uvs);

      myGeometry.flipV();


      // Print the flipped texture coordinates.

      // Output: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]

  calculateBoundingBox:

      <p>A bounding box is the smallest rectangular prism that contains the
      entire

      geometry. It's defined by the box's minimum and maximum coordinates along

      each axis, as well as the size (length) and offset (center).</p>

      <p>Calling <code>myGeometry.calculateBoundingBox()</code> returns an
      object with four

      properties that describe the bounding box:</p>

      <pre><code class="language-js">// Get myGeometry's bounding box.

      let bbox = myGeometry.calculateBoundingBox();


      // Print the bounding box to the console.

      console.log(bbox);

      //  // The minimum coordinate along each axis.

      //  min: { x: -1, y: -2, z: -3 },

      //

      //  // The maximum coordinate along each axis.

      //  max: { x: 1, y: 2, z: 3},

      //

      //  // The size (length) along each axis.

      //  size: { x: 2, y: 4, z: 6},

      //

      //  // The offset (center) along each axis.

      //  offset: { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0}

  clearColors:
    description: >
      <p>Removes the geometry’s internal colors.</p>

      <p><code>p5.Geometry</code> objects can be created with "internal colors"
      assigned to

      vertices or the entire shape. When a geometry has internal colors,

      <a href="/reference/p5/fill/">fill()</a> has no effect. Calling

      <code>myGeometry.clearColors()</code> allows the

      <a href="/reference/p5/fill/">fill()</a> function to apply color to the
      geometry.</p>
    path: p5.Geometry/clearColors
  flipU:

      <p>Flips the geometry’s texture u-coordinates.</p>

      <p>In order for <a href="/reference/p5/texture/">texture()</a> to work,
      the geometry

      needs a way to map the points on its surface to the pixels in a

      <code>(x, y, z)</code> maps to the texture image's pixel at coordinates

      to the

      geometry. Calling <code>myGeometry.flipU()</code> flips a geometry's
      u-coordinates

      so that the texture appears mirrored horizontally.</p>

      <p>For example, a plane's four vertices are added clockwise starting from

  computeFaces:
    description: >
      <p>Computes the geometry's faces using its vertices.</p>

      <p>All 3D shapes are made by connecting sets of points called vertices. A

      geometry's surface is formed by connecting vertices to form triangles that

      are stitched together. Each triangular patch on the geometry's surface is

      called a face. <code>myGeometry.computeFaces()</code> performs the math
      needed to

      define each face based on the distances between vertices.</p>

      <p>The geometry's vertices are stored as <a
      href="/reference/p5/p5.Vector">p5.Vector</a>

      objects in the <a
      href="/reference/p5.Geometry/vertices/">myGeometry.vertices</a>

      array. The geometry's first vertex is the

      <a href="/reference/p5/p5.Vector">p5.Vector</a> object at
      <code>myGeometry.vertices[0]</code>,

      its second vertex is <code>myGeometry.vertices[1]</code>, its third vertex
      is

      <code>myGeometry.vertices[2]</code>, and so on.</p>

      <p>Calling <code>myGeometry.computeFaces()</code> fills the

      <a href="/reference/p5.Geometry/faces/">myGeometry.faces</a> array with
      three-element

      arrays that list the vertices that form each face. For example, a geometry

      made from a rectangle has two faces because a rectangle is made by joining

      two triangles. <a
      href="/reference/p5.Geometry/faces/">myGeometry.faces</a> for a

      rectangle would be the two-dimensional array

      <code>[[0, 1, 2], [2, 1, 3]]</code>. The first face,
      <code>myGeometry.faces[0]</code>, is the

      array <code>[0, 1, 2]</code> because it's formed by connecting

      <code>myGeometry.vertices[0]</code>,
      <code>myGeometry.vertices[1]</code>,and

      <code>myGeometry.vertices[2]</code>. The second face,
      <code>myGeometry.faces[1]</code>, is the

      array <code>[2, 1, 3]</code> because it's formed by connecting

      <code>myGeometry.vertices[2]</code>, <code>myGeometry.vertices[1]</code>,
      and

      <code>myGeometry.vertices[3]</code>.</p>

      <p>Note: <code>myGeometry.computeFaces()</code> only works when geometries
      have four or more vertices.</p>

  computeNormals:
    description: >
      <p>Calculates the normal vector for each vertex on the geometry.</p>

      <p>All 3D shapes are made by connecting sets of points called vertices. A

      geometry's surface is formed by connecting vertices to create triangles

      that are stitched together. Each triangular patch on the geometry's

      surface is called a face. <code>myGeometry.computeNormals()</code>
      performs the

      math needed to orient each face. Orientation is important for lighting

      and other effects.</p>

      <p>A face's orientation is defined by its normal vector which points out

      of the face and is normal (perpendicular) to the surface. Calling

      <code>myGeometry.computeNormals()</code> first calculates each face's
      normal vector.

      Then it calculates the normal vector for each vertex by averaging the

      normal vectors of the faces surrounding the vertex. The vertex normals

      are stored as <a href="/reference/p5/p5.Vector">p5.Vector</a> objects in
      the

      <a
      href="/reference/p5.Geometry/vertexNormals/">myGeometry.vertexNormals</a>
      array.</p>

      <p>The first parameter, <code>shadingType</code>, is optional. Passing the
      constant

      <code>FLAT</code>, as in <code>myGeometry.computeNormals(FLAT)</code>,
      provides neighboring

      faces with their own copies of the vertices they share. Surfaces appear

      tiled with flat shading. Passing the constant <code>SMOOTH</code>, as in

      <code>myGeometry.computeNormals(SMOOTH)</code>, makes neighboring faces
      reuse their

      shared vertices. Surfaces appear smoother with smooth shading. By

      default, <code>shadingType</code> is <code>FLAT</code>.</p>

      <p>The second parameter, <code>options</code>, is also optional. If an
      object with a

      <code>roundToPrecision</code> property is passed, as in

      <code>myGeometry.computeNormals(SMOOTH, { roundToPrecision: 5 })</code>,
      it sets the

      number of decimal places to use for calculations. By default,

      <code>roundToPrecision</code> uses 3 decimal places.</p>

      <p>Calling <code>myGeometry.normalize()</code> translates the geometry's
      vertices so that

      they're centered at the origin <code>(0, 0, 0)</code>. Then it scales the
      vertices so

      that they fill a 100×100×100 box. As a result, small geometries will grow

      and large geometries will shrink.</p>

  vertexProperty:
    description: >
      <p>Sets the shader's vertex property or attribute variables.</p>

      <p>A vertex property, or vertex attribute, is a variable belonging to a
      vertex in a shader. p5.js provides some

      default properties, such as <code>aPosition</code>, <code>aNormal</code>,
      <code>aVertexColor</code>, etc. These are

      set using <a href="/reference/p5/vertex/">vertex()</a>, <a
      href="/reference/p5/normal/">normal()</a>

      and <a href="/reference/p5/fill/">fill()</a> respectively. Custom
      properties can also

      be defined within <a href="/reference/p5/beginShape/">beginShape()</a> and

      <a href="/reference/p5/endShape/">endShape()</a>.</p>

      <p>The first parameter, <code>propertyName</code>, is a string with the
      property's name.

      This is the same variable name which should be declared in the shader, as
      in

      <code>in vec3 aProperty</code>, similar to .<code>setUniform()</code>.</p>

      <p>The second parameter, <code>data</code>, is the value assigned to the
      shader variable. This value

      will be pushed directly onto the Geometry object. There should be the same
      number

      of custom property values as vertices, this method should be invoked once
      for each

      vertex.</p>

      <p>The <code>data</code> can be a Number or an array of numbers. Tn the
      shader program the type

      can be declared according to the WebGL specification. Common types include
      <code>float</code>,

      <code>vec2</code>, <code>vec3</code>, <code>vec4</code> or matrices.</p>

      <p>For example, a geometry made from a rectangle has two faces because a

      rectangle is made by joining two triangles. <code>myGeometry.faces</code>
      for a

      rectangle would be the two-dimensional array <code>[[0, 1, 2], [2, 1,
      3]]</code>.

      The first face, <code>myGeometry.faces[0]</code>, is the array <code>[0,
      1, 2]</code> because

      it's formed by connecting <code>myGeometry.vertices[0]</code>,

      <code>myGeometry.vertices[1]</code>,and
      <code>myGeometry.vertices[2]</code>. The second face,

      <code>myGeometry.faces[1]</code>, is the array <code>[2, 1, 3]</code>
      because it's formed by

      connecting <code>myGeometry.vertices[2]</code>,
      <code>myGeometry.vertices[1]</code>,and

      <code>myGeometry.vertices[3]</code>.</p>

      <p>An array that lists the texture coordinates for each of the geometry's

      vertices.</p>

      <p>In order for <a href="/reference/p5/texture/">texture()</a> to work,
      the geometry

      needs a way to map the points on its surface to the pixels in a

      rectangular image that's used as a texture. The geometry's vertex at

      coordinates <code>(x, y, z)</code> maps to the texture image's pixel at
      coordinates

      <code>(u, v)</code>.</p>

      <p>The <code>myGeometry.uvs</code> array stores the <code>(u, v)</code>
      coordinates for each

      vertex in the order it was added to the geometry. For example, the

      first vertex, <code>myGeometry.vertices[0]</code>, has its <code>(u,
      v)</code> coordinates

      stored at <code>myGeometry.uvs[0]</code> and
      <code>myGeometry.uvs[1]</code>.</p>
