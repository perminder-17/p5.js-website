  <p>Calculates coordinates along a spline curve using interpolation.</p>

  <p><code>splinePoint()</code> calculates coordinates along a spline curve
  using the

  anchor and control points. It expects points in the same order as the

  <a href="/reference/p5/spline/">spline()</a> function.
  <code>splinePoint()</code> works one axis

  at a time. Passing the anchor and control points' x-coordinates will

  calculate the x-coordinate of a point on the curve. Passing the anchor and

  control points' y-coordinates will calculate the y-coordinate of a point on

  the curve.</p>

  <p>The first parameter, <code>a</code>, is the coordinate of the first control
  point.</p>

  <p>The second and third parameters, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code>, are the
  coordinates of the

  anchor points.</p>

  <p>The fourth parameter, <code>d</code>, is the coordinate of the last control
  point.</p>

  <p>The fifth parameter, <code>t</code>, is the amount to interpolate along the
  curve. 0

  is the first anchor point, 1 is the second anchor point, and 0.5 is halfway

  between them.</p>
